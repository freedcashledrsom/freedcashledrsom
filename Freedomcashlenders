When Pew surveyed payday loan borrowers, 8 in 10 said they would switch to borrowing from their bank if it began offering small loans and they were likely to be approved. Their top criteria for choosing where to borrow from included how quickly the money would be available, how certain they would be to be approved, and how easy it would be to apply. The banks all have simple, quick online or mobile applications and put the loan proceeds in customers’ accounts within minutes. That’s far faster and easier than the process of any payday lender. This speed and ease suggest robust customer uptake of bank small loans.
